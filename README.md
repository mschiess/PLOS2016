# Somato-dendritic Synaptic Plasticity and Error-backpropagation in Active Dendrites

Here you can fing the Mathematica notebooks files that contains the code and the figures of our 2016 [PLOS computational biology paper](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004638).

Each notebook corresponds to a figure number. The function *learnInFile* save the result of the learning procedure in a text file (see the *out* folder). All the simulations results are already in the *out* folder. To save some substantial computational time you can skip the execution of the *learnInFile* calls.
